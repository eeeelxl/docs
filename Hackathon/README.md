# Community Competitions

A list of past (and upcoming) hackathons/other challenges. <br/>*Read this in other languages: [简体中文](README.zh-cn.md), [日本語](README.jp.md),.*

### NGD Goal

We believe that Hackathons and community led competitions can be very helpful for connecting the neo community and developing the neo ecosystem.

### Event types
- **Hackathons** 

  Theme-based, large scale events focusing on the development of dApps on the NEO blockchain or other applications related to the community. These events are often announced a few months in advance, held in a specified city, and often last from one day to an entire weekend. 

- **Challenges**

  Challenges are often smaller in scale compared to Hackathons. Participants will be provided with several problems specific to the development side of NEO, with difficulty ranging from novice up to advanced. These events could be held either online or in a physical venue. 
  
- **Design Competitions**

  Design competitions will often be announced and held online. Any individual designer or team can enter the competition with their work.
